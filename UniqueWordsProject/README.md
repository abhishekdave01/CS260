This assignment utilizes singly linked lists and hash table data structures to parse through text files.
There is a hashing function used to provide a unique key to each word and for collisions the program chains each words to a corresponding singly linked list which is
stored as an index of the hash table.
The program provides statistics on the number of total words and unique words in each text file while also displaying the average size of each index in the hash table.
The entirety of the program had been written by Abhishek Dave
